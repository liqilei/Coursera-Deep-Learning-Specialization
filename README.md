# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

This specialization include 5 parts.

They are:

#### Neural Networks and Deep Learning

#### Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

#### Structuring Machine Learning Projects

#### Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Sequence Models

I have finished those exercises and share it to github, I sincerely hope that anyone would contribute any suggestion or any punishment to this work. I do hope to have opportunity to discuss this homework.

If you have any problem with those codes, please feel free to contact my by mailto: qilei.li@foxmail.com.
